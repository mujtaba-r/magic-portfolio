“Life’s an amalgamation of impossibilities”, we’ve heard this phrase before, perhaps come across it while searching for an inspirational quote for our next Instagram post, but what does it really **mean?**

Look around you, the world is a vast, exponential, seemingly endless oasis of impossibilities, from the bird that flies to the heart that breaks and dares to love again, the term *impossible* is misleading and grossly misused because everything that’s happening around you is, in essence, **impossible.**

Don’t believe me? The Oxford Dictionary defines the word “impossible” as “not able to occur, exist, or be done”, look around again, what around you is definitely supposed to be there, look at yourself, move your arms around, you’re manipulating a countless amount of muscle tissue to perform so base a task, that, in itself, is an impossibility and yet, these impossibilities are often taken for granted.

Everything you see, hear or even **feel**, is completely impossible and that is what makes it so **real**. Reality *is* impossibility. Take, for example, love; when you love someone, your entire reality warps into something that now encompasses an entire other being into a life you once considered solely your own; your entire perception of how the world works changes and in that moment you realize everyone living a life without love is living an impossible version of reality; only because to them, it is their **only** reality while to the lover, it is an **impossibility.**

Since the dawn of time itself, man has faced and overcome impossibility after impossibility, achieved flight, space travel, speeds faster than the fastest animals, and so much more. Impossible doesn’t exist, there is just possible and that which can be made possible with time; like how, taking the love example, after breaking up and believing that loving the same person again is impossible, one might find the impossible slowly becoming possible once again and such is human nature, deriving possible from impossible since before there were books to record such occurrences or clocks to record time to the accuracy of one-millionth of a second. With time science fiction has become science **fact**, love has turned to hate which has turned back to love again and the birds and bees are no longer sovereign rulers of the sky.
Of course, no journey is without its hurdles. There were moments of doubt, failed prototypes, and unforeseen obstacles that tested my resolve. However, those challenges taught me the importance of adaptability, creative thinking, and collaboration. They pushed me to improve, to think outside the box, and to view setbacks not as failures, but as opportunities to learn and grow.

Don’t tell yourself something is impossible, no matter how hopeless a certain situation may seem. It’s embedded deep within human nature to make the impossible possible, because life isn’t really an amalgamation of impossibilities, it’s the story of what *has been* and what *will be.*
