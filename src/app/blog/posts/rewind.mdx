Ever wish life had a rewind button? Well, youâ€™re not the only one.

In fact, youâ€™d be hard pressed to find someone who doesnâ€™t regret that missed deadline that made them end up in the prestigious IqraU or the elaichi they accidentally chewed on in that biryani their khala Bilqis set out for them. Those are examples ladies and gentlemen; they may not apply to everyone but letâ€™s accept the fact that *something*, no matter how insignificant, is affecting your mood and, hence, the vibes youâ€™re giving off. I, too, like you, am afflicted. My problems range from mismatched socks to post-apocalyptic chaos but I need you to know something; Iâ€™m dealing with it. 

Itâ€™s ironic how most of us consider English a superior language due, in part, to our colonial mindset and yet we find the best and most relatable analogies in works of Urdu. 

I refer here to a story that was part of the Urdu as a first language Cambridge O level syllabus for a few years. The name of the story has since faded from memory, possibly, to make room for satanic Further Math formulae, however; one lesson in particular  that that story taught has been fundamentally important in stabilizing my sanity and giving me hope. A crude conversion of said life lesson into English would be that God (or whatever deity you choose to believe in) will test us, however; weâ€™ll only be burdened with as much as God knows we can carry and that is, perhaps, the most beautiful and human moral that one can derive from a piece of literature.

Now, you might think to yourself, look at xyz, he/she is living it big time, look at those clothes, that car, the easy confidence, none of the awkwardity that youâ€™re probably afflicted with right now. Most other people seem calm and in control, but let me tell you something, itâ€™s always calm before the storm.

That guy you just saw walking past you with his head held high, a confident swagger in his stride; the same person probably goes home and binge watches shows like The Real Housewives of Atlanta on Netflix and has the signature tissue box and tub of ice cream to match.

The point is, nothing is as it seems. You can fool me, you can fool the world, but you canâ€™t fool yourself. 

You have problems, you do. And hereâ€™s the beauty of it; those problems make you who you are. 

So look at yourself in the mirror, or the Snapchat app front cam with the dog filter on (whichever one you prefer :p) and smile. Bet that felt good. Now, ask yourself when was the last time you smiled at a mirror and not pouted or sucked in your cheeks or tried to flatten your stomach. My guess is itâ€™s been a while.

Iâ€™ve wished for a rewind button for years now, trust me. Iâ€™m as unhappy as you are. But thatâ€™s just it. Iâ€™m unhappy, not depressed. I donâ€™t cut my wrists or drink bleach or watch that episode in Bleach where the guy cuts his wrists. My point is, youâ€™ve been given this life and all the ups and downs that come with it for a reason. Your life has a purpose and if youâ€™re thinking of throwing in the towel and calling it a day, trust me, DONâ€™T.

In another world, at another time, you had another life. Carefree and sheltered, you aspired to blossom into something beautiful. Life was simpler, suicide was haraam and love didnâ€™t exist. Then, you grew up and reality hit you, hard. And, like a black and white silent film suddenly corrupted by color and sound, you saw your world shattered and remade, this time, not tailored to your specifications.

Friends became plastic, enemies; innumerable. Life became focused on the smaller picture, like shoddy work done by a wannabe movie director that never made the final cut. Now, you find yourself spiraling out of control, balancing a watermelon on a plate meant for an egg and you tell yourself youâ€™re fine, youâ€™re dealing with it, itâ€™s just another day in your life, but youâ€™re not fine, youâ€™re caving and, if youâ€™re one of those poor sops who take life one day at a time, narrowing your vision by choice; I feel sorry for you and you really shouldnâ€™t read on.

Now if you know whatâ€™s up, let me propose a solution. I could fill pages and pages on this particular solution but if I had to sum it up in one word, it would be TRUST.

It doesnâ€™t matter who or what you trust in. It could be a person, it could be a deity, it could be an article from your childhood that you feel incomplete without (I see your blankies and teddy bears people ðŸ˜‰ ) but you need to trust in that someone or something like itâ€™s an anchor that keeps you grounded and while that particular thing or person is in your life, you need to believe that life will get better. Even when all else falls into anarchy and oblivion, when that abyss looms ahead of you and youâ€™re unsure about proceeding or not you need to know that THAT person or thing will be there with you, rooting you in place as everything around you falls to pieces and darkness envelops you.

And that brings me to the end of my rant. Look, in this ever changing world we live in, weâ€™ve lost our way. Weâ€™ve literally forgotten that there actually exists an emotion that could help with whatever ails us right now. Here, Iâ€™m talking about hope. 

I wonâ€™t tell you to hope that it gets better tomorrow, because it doesnâ€™t. Life probably doesnâ€™t go uphill from here on out. Thatâ€™s right. Hate to break it to you, but youâ€™ve probably lived out your glory days gurgling and giggling, sucking on lollipops. However, hope is a very adult emotion. Not everyone gets the fundamentals of the word and maybe thatâ€™s because theyâ€™re too difficult to put into words but if youâ€™re on the verge and see no other way out but down; HOPE, and it might just surprise you.
