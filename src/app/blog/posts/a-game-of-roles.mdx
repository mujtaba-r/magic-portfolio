Alan Moore said it best,

## "All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That’s how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day."

It’s time for something… unorthodox.

These aren’t the best days for any of us, some have it better, some have it worse, but everyone in the world is affected to some extent. Whether you are the businessman/businesswoman who has been forced to make reductions and slow production, the office worker who has been forced to work from home or in some cases been fired with little to no notice, or the student whose mental health is deteriorating faster than the speed of sound, you are not alone.

Already we see how unique this new pandemic is in its ability to turn country against country, state against state, city against city, household against household, and brother against sister (and vice versa). Infamous highlights include the bizarre toilet paper shortages, 5G being blamed for the spread of the virus, the loss of so many beloved icons, and the rise of trending, previously-meaningless terms such as “essential worker”, “social distancing”, and “*insert virtual meeting platform name here*”, to name a few.

For some, like rising college graduates, it is a time of uncertainty. For others, like those who have lost someone they love to the pandemic, it is a time of grief. For others still, like the student stuck at home, it is a time of boredom and, in some cases, poor mental health. If you are reading this and feel that any of the cases above apply to you, you are not alone.

The reason I repeat that statement is to address a rising concern among a populace as large and varied as, well— the entire population of the world. In a time that has given birth to so many new terms, we seem to have forgotten one more essential than the most essential worker— common good.

Much like an essential worker, each one of us plays an essential role— that of denizen in the world of common good. Common good dictates the need for collective action to be able to make progress towards a goal that benefits a majority. The majority, in this case, is all of us. It is how you perform in your role that determines how the pandemic affects your brother, your sister, your households, others’ households, your state, your country, and the world at large.

Of course, Alan Moore, too, makes a valid point. Just as there are two sides to a coin, there are (broadly) two approaches to a global crisis. For the sake of this post, I have chosen to focus on neither in particular, and I state only that Alan Moore penned those words for the fictitious, psychotic villain— Batman’s Joker. Psychosis pertains to a detachment from reality that can only lead to a long, meandering spiral into lunacy— and there are those who succumb to playing the role of the lunatic; this post is as much for them as it is not.

Student, stay-at-home parent, working-from-home individual, or essential worker, you are part of a new and extremely fragile ecosystem, one that can be adjusted to— but only if you adhere to the (not-so-hard-to-follow) rules in this Game of Roles.
