Life, that four lettered word that is more significant to you than that diamond you saw at the jewelry store or that Patek Philippe watch you glanced stared at when you thought no one was looking or the Rolls Royce you’re wanting to buy but never really seem to have the means of doing so. Life is the chest that contains all the jewels you’ve amassed or are likely to amass during that 70 (?) year stay here. I’m going to break it to you though, in words that will ease the pain and pave the way to a comfortable slide down that mountain of grief, Life. Isn’t. Everything. Yes, you’ve heard the expressions, You Only Live Once, Life isn’t about finding yourself, it’s about creating yourself, yadda, yadda but the fact is Life f*cks with everyone and it doesn’t matter if you’re THAT high or this low, it doesn’t matter whether you read the beginning of this post laughing, stroked that diamond ring, noticed the time on your Patek Philippe watch and rushed to your Rolls Royce to get to that meeting on time nor does it matter if you read this on a mobile phone you just borrowed from that guy in front of you to text that friend who doesn’t exist, that loved one that isn’t there, life, my friend, has f*cked with us all.

You’ll notice, whether you’re sitting there in that plush and oh-so-comfortable seat or you’re standing next to that trash can hoping for somebody to drop in a copy of yesterday’s newspaper just so you can use it to get that grime off your hands, you’ll notice that there’s something missing. You just nodded, and now you realize that there really is something missing. You’re reading on, a quizzical expression on your face, asking yourself the same question we’ve all asked ourselves at one point in our lives, “What  is missing?“. The answer, is simple (if somewhat of a cliché). The answer is happiness. Yes, that’s right, happiness. But you knew that already, right? You’re probably mad at me, thinking I’ve wasted your time but bear with me, right to the bitter, bitter end. When was the last time you were truly happy? Are you scratching your head yet? Using those little grey cells that store oh-so-much, but are they showing you an instance of happiness from your life or is it all those times you forced that smile on your just so your friends couldn’t see the tortured soul inside, shouting, screaming, begging, to be freed. Is that why you’re aiming for a good long life of 70? What if I told you that 70 isn’t a good, long life? It’s not long and it sure as hell isn’t good. The world’s oldest woman died, what, a week ago, do you think she died happy? Do you think she lived a good life? Let me tell you what her biggest goal in life was towards the end: Having President Obama over for her 117th birthday. Did you automatically construct an outline of her personality? Attention seeker? Check. Fame hogger? Check. Self-Obsessed? Check. But did you stop to consider what she is was behind all that glam and fame? Lonely? Check. Sad? Check. Neglected? Check.

I did not know her, to tell you the truth, nobody did, she might have fooled her sons, her daughters, her husband, her grandchildren and their children and whatnot, but she couldn’t have fool herself, she was sad, isolated and lonely to the bitter end. If you wanna end up like her I suggest you continue with the whole ‘I want that diamond’ or ‘That watch looks cool’ thing but I give you honest, sincere advice, the sort that you should cherish, write down as a reminder and wake up to every morning.
