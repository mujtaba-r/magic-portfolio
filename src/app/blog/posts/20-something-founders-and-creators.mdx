*Experience is the best teacher.*

*Fake it till you make it.*

*Self-confidence is key.*

If you‚Äôre a 20-something jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none like me, you‚Äôve probably heard at least one of these popular opinions from the plethora of voices you trust to guide you on your journey towards making sense of the road ahead.

What you and I tend to hear less of is actual constructive criticism, an idealistic empathetic notion that, in my opinion, is all but lost in the world we live in today. Yes, it still exists, but in the muted sense of a whisper versus the tidal wave of real advice that made many 30 somethings all over the world the millionaires they are today.

So how does one fix this problem? Whether you‚Äôre building a blog, a social media presence, a next-gen product, or a business, useful feedback from real people is the bread and butter for your metaphorical dinner plate. And just like bread and butter, ***too much can be as unhealthy as too little.***

I‚Äôve been writing about tech that catches my eye for a while now. Before that, I used to write abstract pieces of poetry and self-help articles. I also enjoy generating art using popular AI solutions like Midjourney, and I try to stay fit by going to the gym every now and then. In the midst of all of this, I decided to start a future-oriented Metaverse business called Inqilaab (that means revolution in my local language, Urdu; a bit grandiose, I know) with some extremely talented 20-somethings looking for a challenge from life. While I really enjoy these different areas of creative focus for myself, they can be a bit of an energy suck. The term ‚Äúspread too thin‚Äù is a regular thought that crosses the mind when I tend to think about myself as a 20-something individual in the most objective sense.

I struggle with ADHD and the many complications that come with it, and when you‚Äôre overly involved in all these aspects of growth while trying to balance that with self-care, you tend to develop an acute sense of what your limits are. Currently my limit is a 20-hour work day 7 days in a row, and that‚Äôs definitely one place where the ‚Äúexperience is the greatest teacher‚Äù advice rings true.

If we‚Äôre in the same boat, you‚Äôve probably heard enough opinions by now to want to tear your hair out, so let me provide you with two lesser known facts that my experience so far has taught me. If they prove helpful to you on your own creative journey, then be sure to come back here and let me know! I love that warm fuzzy feeling of being able to impact someone‚Äôs life in a positive way. Lord knows we could all use some positivity in these trying times.

## Fact #1: Life is an iterative process of learning & doing

We‚Äôve all been there before. Writer‚Äôs block, artistic fatigue, college/school term burnout, and mental health spirals. What‚Äôs common amongst all these different types of struggles is you‚Äôll often find yourself in a ‚Äúdoing‚Äù mentality when it happens. You‚Äôll be proactively writing, drawing, designing, planning, strategizing, working, and then all of a sudden‚Ä¶ whoosh! Your brain clogs and you‚Äôre back to your version of the drawing board, your ‚Äúpen‚Äù in hand, your original thoughts stifled, nowhere to be found.

We all have our ways of dealing with this, and that steps into opinion territory so I‚Äôll gloss over those details. The fact is that the next step usually involves some level of learning before you get back to doing. Learning to pace yourself, learning the meaning of a word you‚Äôre trying to add to that article you‚Äôre writing, learning a new stroke technique, or learning the next steps for your business through all kinds of research (which is basically also just a fancier term for learning).

In Eric Ries‚Äôs critically acclaimed book, ‚ÄúThe Lean Startup‚Äù, Ries talks about the cycle of Building, Measuring, and Learning, a process for achieving great results in a relatively small amount of time, instead of just by mindlessly ‚Äúdoing stuff‚Äù and hoping Lady Luck takes care of the rest.

To generalize Eric‚Äôs advice in a factual context, if you‚Äôre a 20-something Founder or Creator, try to segment life into processes revolving around two key themes: learning and doing. You‚Äôve got more time than most to get where you‚Äôre going, and by thinking this way, you simplify your own life by adopting that healthy ‚Äúmarathon, not a sprint‚Äù mentality. That leaves you with time to go searching for that constructive criticism you need to succeed, and also for that leg day you skipped out on (and blamed on a busy day ü§ï).

## Fact #2: Your perception of the world defines the problems you can solve

- Do you view the world as a war zone?

- Maybe as a canvas to draw your mark on?

- Or an ocean of chaos in which you‚Äôre an agent of order?

All of those viewpoints are valid in their own way, as are the countless other lenses we, as individuals, tend to perceive the world through. What‚Äôs important, however, is to recognize that these perceptions are ***subjective***. Our perception of the world often says more about us than our personality does.

It defines what sort of people we choose to hang around, it guides our creative processes, and it shows us problems that others might not be able to see, and definitely wouldn‚Äôt be able to solve. It gives us ***intrinsic value***. Being aware of one‚Äôs own worldview lens allows for the development of *contrarian* thought, a way of thinking where you are able to regard two or more contradicting opinions ***objectively***.

This is essential for finding that constructive criticism you seek to grow as an individual, or even as part of a team, because, let‚Äôs face it‚Ää‚Äî you can‚Äôt be right about everything all the time. The sooner you learn to recognize that and check your biases, the sooner you‚Äôll move towards objective & universal truths‚Ää‚Äî and that‚Äôs where the biggest opportunities for growth lie.
