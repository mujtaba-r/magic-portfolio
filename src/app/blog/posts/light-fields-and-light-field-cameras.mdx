If you’re reading this, then there’s a good chance you’ve heard about Light fields and Light field Cameras. But what exactly are they? And how do they work? In this blog post, we will discuss everything you need to know about these exciting new technologies!

Google’s research team has been at the forefront of developing light field technology. In 2016, they released a white paper that detailed their work on “light field cameras for computational photography.” This work is what led to the development of Google’s Light Field Camera, which was first announced in 2018.

So how do light fields work? In short, they capture information about the direction and intensity of light rays. This allows for a more realistic representation of three-dimensional scenes.

There are many potential applications for this technology. For example, it could be used to create more realistic virtual reality experiences. Additionally, it could be used to improve the quality of photos and videos taken with traditional cameras.

If you’re interested in learning more about light fields and Google’s Light Field Camera, be sure to check out their white paper. It’s a great resource for anyone who wants to learn more about this exciting new technology!
