summary: "If youâ€™re anything like me, you have to make a very conscious effort before you can adopt any new habits. Youâ€™ve tried time and time again to establish routine but youâ€™ve got too much going on during the day to manually adopt a healthy pattern. Factor in a demanding full-time project and levels of risk that sometimes lead to 24-hour work days, and weâ€™ve got ourselves a real problem."

If youâ€™re anything like me, you have to make a very conscious effort before you can adopt any new habits. Youâ€™ve tried time and time again to establish routine but youâ€™ve got too much going on during the day to manually adopt a healthy pattern. Factor in a demanding full-time project and levels of risk that sometimes lead to 24-hour work days, and weâ€™ve got ourselves a real problem.

Lucky for us, we donâ€™t HAVE to do everything manually any more!

Here are my favorite tech pals keeping me productive and helping me manage my time and energy:

## The Balance App

Ever wanted a meditation app that uses AI to provide you with a personalized guided meditation plan? Thatâ€™s not even the best part. How about a yearâ€™s subscription for free? Still not sold? What if I told you the AI decisions are based on informed questions that actually set you on your own meditative journey? All in all this app has helped me train in many different categories of mindfulness and allows me to start the day off fresh and rejuvenated 10/10 times. Check the magic out for yourself at https://balanceapp.com/

## The Pillow App

The Pillow App is a wonderful tool that helps track your sleep. It allows you to identify patterns of deep or light sleep, and the premium version allows you to review audio recordings during times of disturbed sleep. This has been a real game changer for someone who talks in their sleep! As a bonus, Iâ€™ve been able to track improvements in my sleep ever since I started using the Balance App, providing a nice back and forth verification of the science behind the apps for the skeptical user. Check it out over at https://pillow.app/

## Todoist

A todo list seems simple enough to draft up, but try maintaining one and youâ€™ll soon see why most people donâ€™t bother. In comes Todoist, a simple and intuitive application designed with one goal in mind- making the todo list maintainable. With in-app goals, an experience points system, easy listing and tracking of tasks, and integrations with most web browsers, this is my ultimate go to for personal reminders and commitment management, and it has yet to let me down.

## Notion

Bored of your Notes app? Have a billion arbitrary notes open, some even empty? Same here! Boy do I have the app for you. Introducing Notion, the ultimate note-taking solution. What I love about this app is the sheer modularity: imagine having pizza orders and your startupâ€™s roadmap on the same notes app, organized in a way thatâ€™s both accessible and appealing to look at. Done imagining? Well head on over to https://www.notion.so/ to turn that imagination into reality!

## Apple Wind Down

Finally, the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance. If you are an Android user, Iâ€™d suggest skipping ahead to the end, and maybe getting an iPhone? Haha, jkâ€¦unless?

I know people have mixed feelings about using the Apple Health app, but hear me out! What if you could use the app to literally power down your phone and wake you up on a scheduled alarm every day? No more excessive hours when passion overtakes reason, no more setting and resetting alarms every day, no more forgetting to set the alarm and waking up after the important board meeting, no. more. time. wasted. period.

If you like what you hear, check out a better way of managing your alarms by opening the Health App and going to Your Schedule -> Sleep -> Wind Down. Donâ€™t forget to set custom Wind Down Shortcuts! I have mine set to open the Balance App and Todoist App so that I always hit the ground running the next day ðŸ˜Œ
